# Configurable helper-files root (orfi-ae-kit + orfi-kit) + orient-executor

**Date:** 2026-06-24
**Status:** Approved (design)
**Repos:** `C:\code\orfi-ae-kit`, `C:\code\orfi-kit` (both updated this session)

## Problem

1. The kit's commands hard-code one user's Windows path `C:\repos\helper_files` as the
   location of the relay, orientation, onboarding, and session-state files. The kit cannot
   be used for a different repo with its own separate state — and cannot be used by anyone
   else — without hand-editing every command file. This is the known limitation already
   flagged in the README and PRD.
2. An `orfi-ae-kit-orient-executor` command exists in the global install
   (`~/.claude/commands/`) but was never added to this repo, its installer, or its Copilot
   skill set. The Executor seat has an orient command in practice but not in the kit.
3. The repo command files have drifted behind the global install: `orient-architect`,
   `relay-to-executor`, and `relay-to-architect` are older/smaller than the global copies.

## Goal

Make the helper-files root **configurable per repo** via a small untracked pointer file
read by **both kits**, add the missing **orient-executor** command (Claude + Copilot), and
bring the orfi-ae-kit repo back in sync with the improved global command bodies.

## Key decisions

- **Pointer-file design** (not install-time templating). The kit is markdown-prompt-only
  with no runtime, so configuration is a file the command bodies instruct the session to
  read. Commands stay generic — no machine-specific text baked in.
- **Per-repo, not global.** Each working repo carries its own pointer so repos never
  overwrite each other's state. A single global path is explicitly rejected.
- **One shared, kit-neutral pointer.** orfi-kit and orfi-ae-kit read the **same** root
  because they share `CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md` (the handoff). Two separate roots would
  split the shared state file and break the handoff.
  - When only orfi-kit is installed, the root is **partially populated** (just
    `CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md`). orfi-ae-kit is a superset consumer of the same root.
- **Decoupled config commands.** Each kit ships its **own** `set-helper-files-root` command
  with identical behavior writing the same pointer. Either kit can configure the path
  standalone; neither depends on the other's command existing. (orfi-kit is only a *soft*
  prerequisite — installer warns, never blocks.)
- **One shared, idempotent config routine.** The same "ensure helper-files-root" logic is
  invoked two ways: **inline (auto)** when any command needing the root finds the pointer
  missing — it creates the folder/gitignore/pointer and continues, no restart; and
  **explicitly** via `set-helper-files-root` to create the config if absent or change the
  path if present. The explicit command is the canonical entry point; the inline path calls
  the same logic. Both create-if-missing and overwrite-if-present.
- **Every consuming command checks the pointer.** Each command that needs the root reads
  `.orfi-kits/helper-files-root` from the current repo first; if missing it runs the config
  routine, then resolves its files under the path. This rule is identical across both kits —
  ae-kit's 6 relay/orient commands and orfi-kit's persist/load-state. Whichever command runs
  first in a repo self-configures; the rest just read the pointer.
- **Both repos, this session.** orfi-kit lives at `C:\code\orfi-kit` (clean, on `main`),
  alongside this repo. The pointer is shared, so doing only half would leave orfi-kit on its
  old `../helper_files` convention while ae-kit uses the pointer — they would disagree. Both
  kits are updated in one coordinated effort (two repos, two commits, two installers).
- **Untracked via a self-contained `.gitignore`.** The pointer lives in a `.orfi-kits/`
  folder whose own `.orfi-kits/.gitignore` contains `*`, ignoring the whole folder (including
  itself). No edits to the repo's root `.gitignore` — no noise for non-kit users. The config
  command also runs `git rm --cached -r .orfi-kits/` if the folder was ever tracked, so it is
  genuinely untracked, not merely ignored.
- **No fallback to `C:\repos\helper_files`.** If the pointer is set, use it. If not, prompt
  the user for a path, write the pointer, then proceed. The old literal path is never
  reintroduced as a default.

## Naming (locked)

| Thing | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Config folder | `.orfi-kits/` (in the working repo root) |
| Pointer file | `.orfi-kits/helper-files-root` — single line: absolute path to the helper-files root |
| Ignore file | `.orfi-kits/.gitignore` containing `*` |
| Command (orfi-ae-kit) | `orfi-ae-kit-set-helper-files-root` |
| Command (orfi-kit) | `orfi-kit-set-helper-files-root` |

## Layout under the root — the `orfi-kits/` subfolder

The helper-files root is a **general bucket** (it may hold golden files, reports, creds, etc.,
unrelated to the kits). The kit files therefore live in a **dedicated `orfi-kits/` subfolder**,
not at the root. The pointer stores the **root** (e.g. `C:\repos\helper_files`); each command
appends the subfolder. (Note: distinct from the dotted `.orfi-kits/` *pointer* folder in the
working repo — same idea, different place.)

```
<helper-files-root>\          ← the pointer stores this
  orfi-kits\                  ← fixed kit-convention subfolder
    architect-orientation.md
    executor-orientation.md
    CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md
    COPILOT-SESSION-STATE.md
    ONBOARDING.md
    relay\
      relay-to-executor.md
      relay-to-architect.md
```

**Per-file convention:** each command body defines `<kit-root>` = `<helper-files-root>\orfi-kits`
**once** at the top (after resolving the pointer), then references `<kit-root>\…` everywhere.

- **orfi-ae-kit reads/writes:** `<kit-root>\relay\relay-to-executor.md`,
  `<kit-root>\relay\relay-to-architect.md`, `<kit-root>\architect-orientation.md`,
  `<kit-root>\executor-orientation.md`, `<kit-root>\CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md`,
  `<kit-root>\ONBOARDING.md`
- **orfi-kit reads/writes:** `<kit-root>\CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md`,
  `<kit-root>\COPILOT-SESSION-STATE.md`

## The config routine (shared shape, both kits)

Both `set-helper-files-root` commands and every inline auto-config share this behavior:

- Take the path from arguments; if none given, prompt the user for it.
- Create `.orfi-kits/` in the current repo if missing.
- Write `.orfi-kits/.gitignore` with a single line `*`.
- Write `.orfi-kits/helper-files-root` with the path (overwrite if it already exists).
- If `.orfi-kits/` was ever tracked, run `git rm --cached -r .orfi-kits/`.
- Confirm the resolved path in one line.

The pointer-read rule used by every consuming command:

- Read `.orfi-kits/helper-files-root` in the current repo.
- If missing → run the config routine above, then continue (no restart).
- Resolve the command's files under the returned path. **No fallback** to `C:\repos\helper_files`.

## Scope — orfi-ae-kit (`C:\code\orfi-ae-kit`)

1. **New config command `orfi-ae-kit-set-helper-files-root`** (Claude command + Copilot
   SKILL.md), implementing the config routine above.

2. **New command `orfi-ae-kit-orient-executor`** (Claude command + Copilot SKILL.md), synced
   from the global copy and adapted to read the pointer.

3. **Make all 6 relay/orient commands read the pointer** (per the pointer-read rule above),
   replacing the literal `C:\repos\helper_files`. The 6 commands:
   `orient-architect`, `orient-executor`, `relay-to-executor`, `relay-read-task`,
   `relay-to-architect`, `relay-read-result`.

4. **Sync the 3 drifted commands** from the global install so the repo carries the improved
   bodies:
   - `orient-architect` — adds the "read relevant ADR spec(s) in full" step and the relay
     reconciliation step.
   - `relay-to-executor` / `relay-to-architect` — add the "update the RELAY FILE STATE
     section of `CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md`" step (relay files have no timestamp; the state
     note is the freshness authority).

5. **Copilot parity.** Mirror the 2 new commands (`orient-executor`, `set-helper-files-root`)
   as `copilot/skills/<name>/SKILL.md`, and apply the same pointer rule + drift sync to the
   existing 4 Copilot skills.

6. **Installer (`install.sh` + `install.ps1`, both — maintenance pair).** Add
   `orfi-ae-kit-orient-executor` and `orfi-ae-kit-set-helper-files-root` to the `COMMANDS`
   and `SKILLS` arrays. No other installer behavior changes.

7. **Docs (`README.md`).** Add the 2 new commands to the command-reference table. Replace the
   "hard-coded relay paths / known limitation" section with the new per-repo pointer-config
   flow (folder, pointer file, untracked `.gitignore`, no-fallback, run set-helper-files-root
   first). Note orfi-kit ships a twin command.

## Scope — orfi-kit (`C:\code\orfi-kit`)

1. **New config command `orfi-kit-set-helper-files-root`** (Claude command + Copilot
   SKILL.md), implementing the same config routine.

2. **Make `load-state` / `persist-state` read the pointer** (Claude commands + their Copilot
   skills), replacing the relative `../helper_files` convention with the pointer-read rule.
   `git-conventions` is **not** touched — it references `helper_files/` only as worktree
   symlink examples, unrelated to the state root.

3. **Installer (`install.sh` + `install.ps1`, both).** Add `orfi-kit-set-helper-files-root`
   to the command/skill arrays.

4. **Docs (`README.md`).** Document the config command and the per-repo pointer flow.

## Cold-start bootstrap — init commands

A freshly-configured root is just a path; the files inside it do not exist yet. Two tiers:

- **Loop-generated** — `CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md` / `COPILOT-SESSION-STATE.md` (persist-state
  writes them) and the relay files (relay-to-* write them). These self-heal.
- **Must pre-exist** — the orientation files; the `orient-*` commands only *point* at them and
  fail with a raw file-not-found if absent. So a bootstrap step is needed.

### `orfi-kit-init`

Run the config routine, then **create placeholders only if absent (never overwrite)** under
the configured root:

- `CLAUDE-SESSION-STATE.md`, `COPILOT-SESSION-STATE.md` — placeholder with guiding comment
  headers (what to record: current phase, RELAY FILE STATE, decisions, blockers).
- `ONBOARDING.md` — placeholder with guiding comment headers prompting for the
  project-specific detail the agnostic orientation defers to it: stack, ADR location,
  test/verification commands, security gate, terminology rules.

### `orfi-ae-kit-init`

A **superset** of `orfi-kit-init` (it builds on orfi-kit, which is its prerequisite — it does
not re-implement the state/onboarding placeholder logic independently). In addition to the
state + onboarding placeholders (created only if absent), it writes the two **orientation
files if absent**:

- `architect-orientation.md`, `executor-orientation.md` — **agnostic** content (below).

### `orient-*` guard

If the relevant orientation file is missing, `orient-architect` / `orient-executor` stop and
advise the user to run `/orfi-ae-kit-init` first. They do not silently auto-create — init is
the deliberate bootstrap.

### Agnostic orientation content

Strip everything project-specific (no Panviva, GSD terminology policy, security-gate tool
tree, `/orfi-run-*` names, C# stack, specific verification tool names). Those belong in
`ONBOARDING.md`, which the orientation redirects the agent to read. Keep only transferable
mechanics:

- **Architect orientation:** who you are (direct/review/decide, don't type code); two-session
  model (Architect → Executor → its sub-agents); first actions (read state, then onboarding
  if it exists, then any project rules/specs those files point to); relay protocol (4 commands
  + round-trip + reconcile-if-stale); how to write a task (goal/scope/constraints/done-when);
  how to review (demand real test numbers, verify claims, scope discipline, stability over
  clean diff — "re-run the project's tests yourself to reconcile", no tool names); what you
  don't do. **Plus the ADR step (Architect only):** read ADR files in full if they exist; if
  none, skip — or ask the human for their path and note it should be recorded in onboarding.
- **Executor orientation:** same generic shape **minus the ADR step** — who you are (implement,
  don't decide architecture/scope/merge); two-session model + fix-your-seat-from-this-file;
  first actions; relay protocol + reconcile-if-stale; how to work (generic rigor: tests-first,
  scope discipline, no fabricated data, report real numbers, stop-and-relay on surprises);
  what you don't do.

## Out of scope

- Replacing the user's existing real orientation files in their current helper-files root —
  init never overwrites an existing file.

## Non-goals

- No runtime, daemon, hook, or app — the kit stays markdown-prompt-only.
- No moving the helper files into the working repo (rejected: risks agents deleting
  "untracked noise", and forces a cross-kit migration of hard-coded paths).
